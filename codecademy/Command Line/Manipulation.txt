Manipulation
Generalizations

Congratulations! You learned how to use the command line to view and manipulate the filesystem. 
What can we generalize so far?

    Options modify the behavior of commands:
        ls -a lists all contents of a directory, including hidden files and directories
        ls -l lists all contents in long format
        ls -t orders files and directories by the time they were last modified
        Multiple options can be used together, like ls -alt
    From the command line, you can also copy, move, and remove files and directories:
        cp [file_path(1 or more)] [destination_path] copies files
        mv [file_path(1 or more)] [destination_path] moves and renames files
        rm [file_path] removes files
        rm -r [file_path] removes directories (and its contents)
    Wildcards (*) are useful for selecting groups of files and directories
